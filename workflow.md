4. Install the necessary dependencies for the backend and frontend.

## Backend Development

1. Write the backend API endpoints using Express.
2. Implement the backend services to handle business logic.
3. Write unit tests for the backend services.
4. Integrate the backend services with the frontend using tRPC.

## Frontend Development

1. Write the frontend components using React.
2. Implement the frontend hooks to handle state and side effects.
3. Write unit tests for the frontend components and hooks.
4. Integrate the frontend with the backend using tRPC.

## Testing

1. Write unit tests for the backend services and frontend components.
2. Write integration tests to ensure the entire application works as expected.
3. Use Cypress as the testing framework.

## Deployment

1. Set up the deployment environment (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
2. Configure the deployment settings (e.g., database, environment variables).
3. Deploy the backend and frontend to the deployment environment.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI).
2. Configure the pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy the application.
3. Automate the deployment process to ensure consistent and reliable releases.

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Set up monitoring and logging tools to track the performance and health of the application.
2. Configure alerts and notifications to notify the development team of any issues or errors.
3. Regularly review logs and metrics to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

## Documentation

1. Update the `specification.md` file with any changes or updates to the project.
2. Document any new features or functionalities.
3. Provide instructions for setting up and deploying the project.

## Code Review

1. Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality and maintainability.
2. Review pull requests and provide feedback to improve code.
3. Address any issues or suggestions raised during the code review process.

## Iterative Development

1. Iterate on the development process, making improvements and optimizations as needed.
2. Continuously gather feedback from stakeholders and users.
3. Prioritize and address any issues or bugs reported.

## Project Management
